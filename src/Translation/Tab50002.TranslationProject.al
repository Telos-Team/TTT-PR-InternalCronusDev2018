// Value description:
// The pre-defined values are defined in the table below.
// Value
// Description
// final
// Indicates the terminating state.
// needs-adaptation
// Indicates only non-textual information needs adaptation.

// Indicates both text and non-textual information needs review.
// needs-review-translation
// Indicates that only the text of the item needs to be reviewed.
// needs-translation
// Indicates that the item needs to be translated.
// new
// Indicates that the item is new. For example, translation units that were not in a previous version of the document.
// signed-off
// Indicates that changes are reviewed and approved.
